#Programming Problems & Solution

> Programming problem solutions from various sites with Hints in C++

##Guidelines

* Use Comments and give hints so that everyone can understand what's going on.
* Maintain directory structure like below:
	
		Problems-AND-Solution/
		├── Site name
		│   └── Problem Category ( if available )
		│       ├── Language name ( if solution for other language is available )
		│       │   └── Solution
		│       └── C/C++ Solution
		├── LICENSE File
		└── README.md


			
##Contributing

There are many problems left without hints. Feel free to add or update the hints by sending a pull a request. The solutions are mostly written in C++. If you have solutions in any other language please make a pull request.
